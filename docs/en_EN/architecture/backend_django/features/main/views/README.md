# 📂 Views

[⬅️ Back](../README.md) | [🏠 Docs Root](../../../../../../README.md)

This directory (`src/backend_django/features/main/views`) contains the Django views for the `main` feature. Views are responsible for processing web requests and returning appropriate HTTP responses, often by rendering HTML templates. This modular organization (one file per view) promotes cleaner code and easier navigation.

## Purpose

The views in this directory handle the logic for displaying various public-facing pages of the website, such as the homepage, team page, legal pages, contact page, and services page.
