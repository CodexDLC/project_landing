# 📂 Logs Directory

[⬅️ Back](../README.md) | [🏠 Docs Root](../../../README.md)

This directory (`src/backend_django/logs`) is designated for storing application log files generated by the backend services. It provides a centralized location for logs, which is crucial for monitoring, debugging, and troubleshooting the application.

## Purpose

The `logs` directory serves as the primary output destination for various types of application logs, including:
*   Access logs.
*   Error logs.
*   Application-specific informational messages.

Centralizing logs simplifies their collection by external monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana Agent, Logstash) and helps in quickly identifying issues within the backend.

## Structure

| Component | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **[📂 Backend Logs](./backend/README.md)** | Contains logs specifically from the backend application. |
